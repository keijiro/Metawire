# Metawire

**Metawire** is a modified version of [Metamesh] that generates wireframe
meshes (line primitives) instead of surface meshes.

[Metamesh]: https://github.com/keijiro/Metamesh

It currently provides the following shape generators:

- Line
- Quad
- Circle
- Box
- Ticks (group of short line segments)
- Grid lines
- Wireframe (mesh to wireframe converter)

## Installation

You can install the Metawire package (`jp.keijiro.metawire`) via the "Keijiro"
scoped registry using the Unity Package Manager. To add the registry to your
project, follow [these instructions].
